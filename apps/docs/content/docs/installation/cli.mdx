  At this time the command line can only install default styled components, not
  new-york. For new york, please copy and paste. The addition of variants is
  being tracked in this

## Add components from CLI

Once you have completed the install steps for the tailwind config and css, you can choose to add components
via CLI instead.

Run the following:

```bash /jolly/
npx @sly-cli/sly add jolly-ui
```

This will list the components available to you to install, and will copy the code over for you.

For a specific component you can also Run

```bash
npx @sly-cli/sly add jolly-ui [component_name]
```
