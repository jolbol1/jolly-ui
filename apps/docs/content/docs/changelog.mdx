## March 2024

Updated [Breadcrumbs](./components/breadcrumbs) component. It now uses shadcn's design an has a new structure to enable more customisability.

## January 2024 - Week 3

### CLI

You can now add components using a command line. This is built using a tool called
[@sly-cli](https://sly-cli.fly.dev/). To get started see [here](../../docs/installation/cli)

## January 2024 - Week 1

### Rename

I have renamed the project from shadcn-aria to JollyUI. It will keep the same goal of mimicking shadcn/ui components and converting them to react aria components.
I simply renamed it as it did not feel right using shadcn's name on a project he hasn't officially endorsed/worked on, besides shadcn/ui itself being open-sourced.

### Theme Customiser

Added a theme customizer to the site so you can customize the docs to your liking, and easily copy the css needed. Fully compatible with shadcn/ui.
