## May 2024

Add [Color Picker](./components/color) examples and [Color Primitives](/components/color-primitives). These are in beta and I will monitor react-aria-components for updates.

Update [Menu](./components/menu) to allow use of submenus.

Updated React-Aria-Componets to 1.2.1

Added[ Color primitives](./components/color). These are beta, as I am currently working on them and full examples on usage.

## March 2024

Updated [Breadcrumbs](./components/breadcrumbs) component. It now uses shadcn's design an has a new structure to enable more customisability.

Added [Searchfield](./components/searchfield) component.

## January 2024 - Week 3

### CLI

You can now add components using a command line. This is built using a tool called
[@sly-cli](https://sly-cli.fly.dev/). To get started see [here](../../docs/installation/cli)

## January 2024 - Week 1

### Rename

I have renamed the project from shadcn-aria to JollyUI. It will keep the same goal of mimicking shadcn/ui components and converting them to react aria components.
I simply renamed it as it did not feel right using shadcn's name on a project he hasn't officially endorsed/worked on, besides shadcn/ui itself being open-sourced.

### Theme Customiser

Added a theme customizer to the site so you can customize the docs to your liking, and easily copy the css needed. Fully compatible with shadcn/ui.
