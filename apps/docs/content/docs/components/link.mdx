Links can be created in HTML with the `<a>` element with an href attribute. However, if the link does not have an href, and is handled client side with JavaScript instead, it will not be exposed to assistive technology properly. Link helps achieve accessible links with either native HTML elements or custom element types.

## Client Side Routing

The `<Link>` component works with frameworks and client side routers like Next.js, Remix and React Router.
As with other React Aria components that support links, this works via the RouterProvider component at the root of your app.
See the [client side routing guide](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/routing.html) to learn how to set this up.
