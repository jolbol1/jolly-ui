## Client Side Routing

The `<Link>` component works with frameworks and client side routers like Next.js, Remix and React Router.
As with other React Aria components that support links, this works via the RouterProvider component at the root of your app.
See the [client side routing guide](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/routing.html) to learn how to set this up.
