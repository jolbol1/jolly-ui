On the surface, building a custom styled button seems simple. However, there are many cross browser inconsistencies in interactions and accessibility features to consider. Button handles all of these interactions for you, so you can focus on the styling.

## Links

The Button component always represents a button semantically.
To create a link that visually looks like a button, use the [Link](../../../docs/components/link) component instead. You can reuse the same styles you apply to the Button component on the Link. It includes support for React Router, NextJs and Remix.

## Events

Button supports user interactions via mouse, keyboard, and touch. You can handle all of these via the `onPress` prop. This is similar to the standard `onClick` event, but normalized to support all interaction methods equally. In addition, the `onPressStart`, `onPressEnd`, and `onPressChange` events are fired as the user interacts with the button.

Each of these handlers receives a `PressEvent`, which exposes information about the target and the type of event that triggered the interaction. See [usePress](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/usePress.html) for more details.
