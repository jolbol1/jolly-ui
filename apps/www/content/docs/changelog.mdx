## December 2023 - v0.0.1

### Rename

I have renamed the project from shadcn-aria to JollyUI. It will keep the same goal of mimicking shadcn/ui components and converting them to react aria components.
I simply renamed it as it did not feel right using shadcn's name on a project he hasnt officially endorsed/worked on, besides shadcn/ui itself being open-sourced.

### Theme Customiser

Added a theme customiser to the site so you can customise the docs to your liking, and easily copy the css needed. Fully compatible with shadcn/ui.
