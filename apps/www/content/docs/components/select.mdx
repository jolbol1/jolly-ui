## Usage

### Basic

<ComponentPreview name="select-demo" />

### Links

The `<SelectItem>` component works with frameworks and client side routers like Next.js, Remix and React Router.
As with other React Aria components that support links, this works via the RouterProvider component at the root of your app.
See the [client side routing guide](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/routing.html) to learn how to set this up.

### Sections

#### Static Items

<ComponentPreview name="select-sections" />

#### Dynamic Items

Sections used with dynamic items are populated from a hierarchical data structure. Similarly to the props on Select, `<SelectSection>` takes an array of data using the items prop.
If the section also has a header, the `SelectCollection` component can be used to render the child items.

<ComponentPreview name="select-dynamic" />

### Disabled

Select supports marking items as disabled using the disabledKeys prop.
Each key in this list corresponds with the id prop passed to the `SelectItem` component, or automatically derived from the values passed to the items prop.
See [Collections](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/Collections.html) for more details.
Disabled items are not focusable, selectable, or keyboard navigable.
