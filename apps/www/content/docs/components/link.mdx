## Client Side Routing

The `<Link>` component works with frameworks and client side routers like Next.js, Remix and React Router.
As with other React Aria components that support links, this works via the RouterProvider component at the root of your app.
See the [client side routing guide](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/routing.html) to learn how to set this up.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Link } from "@/components/ui/link"
```

```tsx
<Link href="https://example.com" variant="outline">
  Link
</Link>
```

Links accept content as children. If the link has an href prop, it will be rendered as an `<a>` element. When a `<Link>` does not have an href prop, it is rendered as a `<span role="link">` instead of an `<a>`. Events will need to be handled in JavaScript with the onPress prop.

## Link

The link component utilizes `buttonVariants`. You can use the variants and sizes found in the [Button](../../../docs/components/button) documentation.

```tsx
import { buttonVariants } from "@/components/ui/buttonVariants"
```

```tsx
<Link className={buttonVariants({ variant: "outline" })}>Click here</Link>
```

## Examples
