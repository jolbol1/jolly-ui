## Usage

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
```

```tsx
<Button variant="outline">Button</Button>
```

## Link

The Button component always represents a button semantically.
To create a link that visually looks like a button, use the [Link](../../../docs/components/link) component instead. You can reuse the same styles you apply to the Button component on the Link. It includes support for React Router, NextJs and Remix.

You can also use the `buttonVariants` helper to create a link that looks like a button, if the Link component does not support your needed component.

```tsx
import { buttonVariants } from "@/components/ui/buttonVariants"
```

```tsx
<Link className={buttonVariants({ variant: "outline" })}>Click here</Link>
```

## Events

Button supports user interactions via mouse, keyboard, and touch. You can handle all of these via the `onPress` prop. This is similar to the standard onClick event, but normalized to support all interaction methods equally. In addition, the `onPressStart`, `onPressEnd`, and `onPressChange` events are fired as the user interacts with the button.

Each of these handlers receives a `PressEvent`, which exposes information about the target and the type of event that triggered the interaction. See [usePress](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/usePress.html) for more details.
