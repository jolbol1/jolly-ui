Text fields can be built with `<Input>` or `<TextArea>` and `<Label>` elements, but you must manually ensure that they are semantically connected via ids for accessibility.
`TextField` helps automate this, and handle other accessibility features while allowing for custom styling.

## Installation

You can use the `TextField` import from react-aria-components as it does not need default styling.
Install the [Input](../../../docs/components/input), [Label](../../../docs/components/label) or [TextArea](../../../docs/components/textarea) component to use within from their respective pages.

<ComponentPreview name="textfield-demo" />

## Usage

Basic usages below. View [Input](../../../docs/components/input) and [TextArea](../../../docs/components/textarea) for more examples.

### Input

<ComponentPreview name="textfield-demo" />

### Text Area

<ComponentPreview name="textfield-textarea" />

### Description

TextField also supports optional description and error message elements, which can be used to provide more context about the field, and any validation messages.

<ComponentPreview name="textfield-desc" />
