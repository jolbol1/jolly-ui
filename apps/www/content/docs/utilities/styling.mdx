react-aria-components has a couple of options when it comes to styling. The components are built using the data attributes method using tailwind. You can however use the other methods if you want.

Methods:

- [Class names](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/styling.html#class-names)
- [Data attributes](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/styling.html#states)
- [Render props](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/styling.html#render-props)

To enable using render props in the class names as well as all other values, I built a helper on top of the `cn` one you may have seen before. This one is called `cnv` and it takes in the render props as its first value. You only need to use this if you plan on extending a component.
