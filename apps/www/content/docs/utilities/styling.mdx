react-aria-components has a couple of options when it comes to styling. The components are built using the data attributes method using tailwind. You can however use the other methods if you want.

Methods:

- [Class names](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/styling.html#class-names)
- [Data attributes](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/styling.html#states)
- [Render props](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/styling.html#render-props)

## Installation

To enable using render props in the class names as well as all other values, I built a helper on top of the `cn` one you may have seen before. This one is called `cnv` and it takes in the render props as its first value. You only need to use this if you plan on extending a component. If you are just using the components you need to add the code below.

```tsx title="utils.tsx"
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}

type ClassFunction<T> = (values: T) => string
type ClassValues<T> = (ClassValue | ClassFunction<T>)[]

// Helper function to allow functions to be input to be calculated with react-aria-components
export function cnv<T>(values: T, ...inputs: ClassValues<T>) {
  const processedInputs = inputs.map((input) => {
    if (typeof input === "function") {
      return input(values)
    }
    return input
  })

  return cn(processedInputs)
}
```
