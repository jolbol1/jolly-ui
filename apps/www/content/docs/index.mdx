## shadcn-ui

Note this library is an **unofficial** spin-off of [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) intended to replace Radix with [react-aria-components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/react-aria-components.html).

It is a work in progress so expect rewrites.

## Set-up

Setup requires you doing the shadcn-ui set-up to generate your tailwind config. You can find these instructions [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation)
