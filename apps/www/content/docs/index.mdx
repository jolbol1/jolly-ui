## shadcn-ui

Note this library is an **unofficial** spin-off of [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) intended to replace Radix with [react-aria-components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/react-aria-components.html).

It is a work in progress so expect rewrites.

## Set-up

Setup requires you doing the shadcn-ui set-up to generate your tailwind config. You can find these instructions [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation)

## Components

Components tagged with `v1` are my original testing to just get the components working. I found this method unsustainable as it was essentially replacing Radix components one to one with react-aria-components, but their api's are rather different.

Components tagged `v2` are my attempt at tackling these components in a way that is more true to the react-aria-components api, while maintaining shadcn styling.

There are some components that I can not yet make within react-aria-components, or some that dont need to be ported from radix in the first place as they did not use it.
