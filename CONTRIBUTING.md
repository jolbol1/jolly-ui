We use a registry system for developing components. You can find the source code for the components under `apps/docs/registry`. The components are organized by styles.

```bash
apps
└── docs
    └── registry
        ├── default
        │   ├── example
        │   └── ui

            └── ui
```

1. You make the changes for every style.
2. You update the documentation.
3. You run `pnpm build:registry` to update the registry.
