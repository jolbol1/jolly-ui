This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

JollyUI aims to take the components offered by [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and translate them to use [react-aria-components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/react-aria-components.html) where possible.

Its intended as an add-on essentially, but can work as a standalone. All components found in this library should work with your existing shadcn/ui components and theme.

## shadcn-ui

[shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) offers beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Many of the components use radix for functionality. These are the main focus for JollyUI to convert.

## React Aria Components

[react-aria-components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/react-aria-components.html) is a library of unstyled React components that helps you build accessible, high quality UI components for your application or design system.

Here is a video where I break down the main benefits of React Aria Components, and why you should use it.

Adobe's team also has a great [blog](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/blog/index.html) where you can learn about the making of React Aria Components. My personal favorite being the [3 part blog series](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/blog/building-a-button-part-1.html) on how to build a Button.

### Compared to Radix

[@devongovett](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1738973926682673347) The biggest difference between React Aria and most other libraries in regards to accessibility is support for mobile screen readers. The ARIA Practices Guide doesn't cover those, so any library that purely bases their implementation on it will miss some important functionality.

## Set-up

Setup requires you doing the shadcn-ui set-up to generate your tailwind config. You can find these instructions [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation)
