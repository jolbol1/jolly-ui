### shadcn cli support

Thanks to [shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn) for recently releasing the [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/changelog#august-2024---npx-shadcn-init), which now allows for other registries to be used. This means JollyUI can be installed easily using the shadcn CLI, and the `components.json` configuration will be respected as well.

To get started with JollyUI using the shadcn CLI, you can now run:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <PackageManagerContent value="npm">
    ```bash
    npx shadcn@latest add https://jollyui.dev/[[STYLE]]/button
    ```
  </PackageManagerContent>
  <PackageManagerContent value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://jollyui.dev/[[STYLE]]/button
    ```

  </PackageManagerContent>
  <PackageManagerContent value="bun">
    ```bash
    bunx --bun shadcn@latest add https://jollyui.dev/[[STYLE]]/button
    ```
  </PackageManagerContent>
  <PackageManagerContent value="yarn">
    ```bash 
    npx shadcn@latest add https://jollyui.dev/[[STYLE]]/button 
    ```
  </PackageManagerContent>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Updated React-Aria-Componets to 1.2.1

Added[ Color primitives](./components/color). These are beta, as I am currently working on them and full examples on usage.

Updated [Breadcrumbs](./components/breadcrumbs) component. It now uses shadcn's design an has a new structure to enable more customisability.

## January 2024 - Week 3

### CLI

You can now add components using a command line. This is built using a tool called
[@sly-cli](https://sly-cli.fly.dev/). To get started see [here](../../docs/installation/cli)

## January 2024 - Week 1

### Rename

I have renamed the project from shadcn-aria to JollyUI. It will keep the same goal of mimicking shadcn/ui components and converting them to react aria components.
I simply renamed it as it did not feel right using shadcn's name on a project he hasn't officially endorsed/worked on, besides shadcn/ui itself being open-sourced.

### Theme Customiser

Added a theme customizer to the site so you can customize the docs to your liking, and easily copy the css needed. Fully compatible with shadcn/ui.
